# **Discoveries**

## **Fiery Cocktail (Su)**
    At 4th level, whenever a fire bomber uses a discovery that deals damage other than fire damage, he can split the damage dice evenly between the bomb's primary damage type and 1d6 points of fire damage; 
    when there is an odd number of damage dice, the odd die of damage comes from the primary damage type. 
    For example, an 8th-level fire bomber could throw a concussive bomb that deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 3d4 points of sonic damage. 
    Additional effects from the bomb still apply, but the save DC for admixture bombs is reduced by 2. 
    This replaces the alchemist's 4th-level discovery.
