# **Discoveries**

## **FIERY COCKTAIL (Su)**
    At 4th level, whenever a fire bomber uses a discovery that deals damage other than fire damage, he can split the damage dice evenly between the bomb's primary damage type and 1d6 points of fire damage; 
    when there is an odd number of damage dice, the odd die of damage comes from the primary damage type. 
    For example, an 8th-level fire bomber could throw a concussive bomb that deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 3d4 points of sonic damage. 
    Additional effects from the bomb still apply, but the save DC for admixture bombs is reduced by 2. 
    This replaces the alchemist's 4th-level discovery.

## **FAST BOMBS**

**Prerequisite**: Alchemist 8

**Benefit**: 

    An alchemist with this discovery can quickly create enough bombs to throw more than one in a single round. The alchemist can prepare and throw additional bombs as a full-round action if his base attack bonus is high enough to grant him additional attacks. This functions just like a full-attack with a ranged weapon.

## **ROCKET BOMB (Su)**

This discovery is available to goblin alchemists.

**Prerequisite**: Alchemist 6th

**Benefit**: 

    Alchemists with this discovery can prepare special rockets to deliver their bombs. Rocket bombs travel farther and explode bigger than normal bombs, but cannot target individual creatures. Rocket bombs explode in a 20-foot radius, and all creatures in that area take the alchemistâ€™s normal splash damage. The range increment on a rocket bomb is 50 feet. Rocket bombs cannot be used with the precise bomb or fast bomb discoveries. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.
