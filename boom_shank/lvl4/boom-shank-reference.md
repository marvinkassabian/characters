### Bag, Handy Haversack

    A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.

    While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.

## **Weapons**

### Crossbow, Light

    Damage: 1d6 (small), 1d8 (medium) 
    Critical: 19-20/x2 Type piercing
    Range Increment: 80 ft. (projectile)
    Category: ranged 
    Proficiency: simple
    Weapon Group: crossbow
    Load: Loading a light crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

    You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. 
    Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. 
    However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a –2 penalty on attack rolls. 
    You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. 
    This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.

### Bomb (su)

    In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are adept at swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert—their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst—the alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster’s component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day—once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for years.

    Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, an alchemist’s bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier. The damage of an alchemist’s bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb’s minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier.

    Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the Discovery ability) as they level up. An alchemist’s bomb, like an extract, becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.

## **Feats**

### **ARMOR PROFICIENCY, LIGHT**

**Requirements**: None

    When you wear a type of armor with which you are proficient, the armor check penalty for that armor applies only to Dexterity- and Strength-based skill checks.

### **BREW POTION**

**Requirements**: Caster level 3rd.

    You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures or objects. 
    Brewing a potion takes 2 hours if its base price is 250 gp or less, otherwise brewing a potion takes 1 day for each 1,000gp in its base price. 
    When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell inquestion and no higher than your own level. 
    To brew a potion, you must use up raw materials costing one half this base price. 
    See the magic item creation rules in Chapter 15 for more information. 
    When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.

### **BURN! BURN! BURN!**

**Requirements**: Disable Device 1 rank, goblin.

    You deal an extra 1d4 points of fire damage when you attack with fire from an alchemical or nonmagical source (such as with alchemical fire or torches) and gain a +4 competence bonus on Reflex saving throws made to avoid catching on fire or to put yourself out when on fire.
    Additional damage caused by this feat does not apply to magical attacks (such as an alchemist's bomb) or to splash damage.

### **POINT-BLANK SHOT**

**Requirements**: None

    You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.

### **RAPID SHOT**

**Requirements**: Dex 13, Point-Blank Shot.

    When making a full-attack action with a ranged weapon, you can fire one additional time this round at your highest bonus. 
    All of your attack rolls take a -2 penalty when using Rapid Shot.

### **THROW ANYTHING**

**Requirements**: None

    You do not suffer any penalties for using an improvised ranged weapon. 
    You receive a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls made with thrown splash weapons.

### **WEAPON PROFICIENCY, SIMPLE**

**Requirements**: None

    You make attack rolls with simple weapons without penalty.

## **Discoveries**

### **Fiery Cocktail (Su)**
    At 4th level, whenever a fire bomber uses a discovery that deals damage other than fire damage, he can split the damage dice evenly between the bomb's primary damage type and 1d6 points of fire damage; 
    when there is an odd number of damage dice, the odd die of damage comes from the primary damage type. 
    For example, an 8th-level fire bomber could throw a concussive bomb that deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 3d4 points of sonic damage. 
    Additional effects from the bomb still apply, but the save DC for admixture bombs is reduced by 2. 
    This replaces the alchemist's 4th-level discovery.

## **Traits**

### **Touched by Ashtanog**

    Whenever you encounter a dead language that you have not experience before, you may roll 1d4. 
    On a 1 you fully comprehend that language, forever.
